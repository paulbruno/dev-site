# Paul Bruno (dev site)

## Status
Pre-alpha â€” yet nevertheless published and online, in recognition that this site, my "career"/dev work, my life are works-in-progress. (Delightfully so.) Building and working with just the markup and styling themselves as "a living thing," so that my design ideas can solidify in a more concrete context, as "hands are in the dirt," so to speak.

Further ideas: using this markup/content base as a jumping-off point to build a few different versions of the site, technologically.
